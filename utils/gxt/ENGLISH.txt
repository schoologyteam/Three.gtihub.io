[SLNCCAC]
~w~Call it what you want,

[SLNCCAD]
~w~but when the Mendez brothers finally work out that we ripped them off,

[SLNCCAE]
~w~you're gonna need all the cash you can get.

[SLNCCAF]
~w~What? And your just gonna sit here?

[SLNCCAG]
~w~Hey, man. It's 'your' empire.

[SLNCDAA]
~w~What're you doing slouching around in here? We're at war dummy.

[SLNCDAB]
~w~Yeah. And you're the soldier - so go soldier.

[SLNCDAC]
~w~And what're you gonna do?

[SLNCDAD]
~w~I'm a behind the scenes man: Infiltration; intelligence; logistics; know what I'm saying?

[SLNCDAE]
~w~I'll tell you what: Why don't you just stay here while I do everything.

Yes, thank you. Sergeant.

[MJRA104:JER_A1]
Good. In here, you can call me Jerry.

[MJRA105:JER_A1]
Okay.

[MJRA106:JER_A1]
Okay... Jerry, huh? Heh heh!

[MJRA107:JER_A1]
Now, Vic, tell me... why did you sign up, huh?

[MJRA109:JER_A1]
To stay out of jail?

[MJRA110:JER_A1]
Because you like getting shouted at, huh?

[MJRA115:JER_A1]
What makes you polish your boots and put bullets in your gun

[MJRA116:JER_A1]
in the hopes that maybe you'll get to shoot someone, huh? Ha ha ha!

[MJRA117:JER_A1]
I got a difficult family. I got responsibilities.

[MJRA118:JER_A1]
What, kids? A broad giving you shit?

[MJRA119:JER_A1]
No, brothers.

[MJRA120:JER_A1]
One is real sick, asthma, and I gotta pay the bills,

[MJRA121:JER_A1]
the other, well, maybe he's sick too, but in a different way...

[MJRA122:JER_A1]
My mom's a mess.

[MJRA123:JER_A1]
So, you joined the army... to get rich?

[MJRA124:JER_A1]
Not exactly. But y'know, my dad he came here from DR, we didn't have a lot of opportunities.

[MJRA125:JER_A1]
What else was I supposed to do? Why did you join up?

[MJRA126:JER_A1]
To get rich!

[MJRA127:JER_A1]
Why are you messing with me, sergeant?

[MJRA128:JER_A1]
I ain't. Chill. Relax. Take a seat. Look, Vic.

[MJRA129:JER_A1]
There are plenty of opportunities for a man who knows the game to make real money. So...

[MJRA130:JER_A1]
I don't want any trouble, man.

[MJRA131:JER_A1]
Who wants trouble? Nobody. Everybody wants to relax. No trouble.

[MJRA132:JER_A1]
Listen, I don't think this is for me. So, if there's nothing else...

[MJRA133:JER_A1]
Hey, relax, huh? Come on Vic. I need a favor. No risk.

[MJRA134:JER_A1]
So why do you need me if there's no risk?

[MJRA135:JER_A1]
Because I gotta take registration. Besides, you're not on duty for a couple of days.

[MJRA136:JER_A1]
Listen, you take my bike, you go over to the airport and you pick up a package for me, huh?

[MJRA137:JER_A1]
Okay, just this one favor and that's it.

[MJRA138:JER_A1]

[JER2_09:JER_A2]
~w~I've been having trouble with them Cholo boys. Some of them have been...

[JER2_10:JER_A2]
~w~What the hell is a Cholo?

[JER2_11:JER_A2]
~w~Bunch of Mexican Gang-bangers. Bad boys, trying to take over all the gun running in town.

[JER2_12:JER_A2]
~w~What the hell? ...Stupid boat.

[JER2_13:JER_A2]
~w~This ought to fix it.

[JER2_17:JER_A2]
~w~Yeah, well, funny thing, you see, it's like this...

[JER2_18:JER_A2]
~w~It's under the floorboards at my old place.

[SJRA2BH:JER_A2]

[MJRA201:JER_A2]
Sure. No worries. Oh, look, I gotta go. The cavalry just turned up. OK, bye. Corporal, what can I do for you?

[MJRA202:JER_A2]
Listen, Jerry, you gotta get rid of that stuff. It's making me nervous.

[MJRA203:JER_A2]
I'm not into drugs, and I don't...

[MJRA204:JER_A2]
Chill the fuck out, my friend. You're really getting on my nerves.

[MJRA205:JER_A2]
Besides, who are you going to get in trouble with? I'm your superior officer...

[MJRA206:JER_A2]
And you told me you needed the money.

[MJRA207:JER_A2]
I do need the money...

[MJRA208:JER_A2]
Uh-huh! But you don't like drugs?

[MJRA209:JER_A2]
I don't think they're a good scene.

Me neither. But you like guns, huh? They don't give you a moral problem I mean?

[MJRA211:JER_A2]
No.

[MJRA212:JER_A2]
Good, cause I know a guy who can sell all the guns we can get him. Which is, trust me, quite a lot.

[MJRA213:JER_A2]
I don't know Sergeant, this is getting heavy.

[MJRA214:JER_A2]
You'll make a whole pile of cash, for nothing. Buy that sick brother of yours a whole lot of candy.

[MJRA215:JER_A2]
What do I have to do?

[MJRA216:JER_A2]
Nothing. Just go and pick up the money from him. He's down over by the docks.

Oh, man... I'm sorry. How did it happen?

[MUBB310:UMB_B3]
It hasn't happened brother. Alberto - that's his Dad - he's over at the wrestling man.

[MUBB311:UMB_B3]
So why the tears?

[MUBB312:UMB_B3]
We just saw some Cholos driving over there man.

So why doesn't someone just go pick up Alberto?

So, I ask you once more, are you men?

[MUBB402:UMB_B4]
Yeah.

[MUBB403:UMB_B4]
Then why you not like balls?

[MUBB404:UMB_B4]
Because that's totally embarassing...

[MUBB405:UMB_B4]
Because that's something you ain't got baby. I got a whole sack full here.

[MUBB406:UMB_B4]
Tons of them. Balls everywhere. Balls to spare.

[MUBB407:UMB_B4]
Well, man, he's certainly full of balls.

[MUBB408:UMB_B4]
You what, baby? You whispering sweet nothings into some bitch's ear? Huh, loverboy?

No boss.

Someone's got to teach these cholos a lesson. I guess I have to go - alone.

[MUBB418:UMB_B4]
Umberto, boss, I'm up for anything, man. I just don't want to have to take my balls out again.

So what's the risk?

[MBYB106:BRY_B1]
Let me put it like this - you will not be handling any drugs.

All I need you to do is keep the cops busy

[MBYB109:BRY_B1]
while Lance and I steal some merch, off the scum who brought it into this country.

The drugs're already here. So we ain't drug trafficking.

[MBYB111:BRY_B1]
Exactly.

[MBYB112:BRY_B1]
You're just the decoy - all you gotta do is make the police think you're carrying.

[MBYB113:BRY_B1]
They can't arrest you for that.

[MBYB114:BRY_B1]
No, but they can shoot me.

Don't be ridiculous!

Of course, he is an artist. The pressure could kill him.

[MRNC304:REN_C3]
I mean, I perform well knowing people want to drill me full of holes, but I am unique, darling.

[MRNC305:REN_C3]
Darling!

[MRNC306:REN_C3]
Hey Reni, hi... uh...

Uh, I'm Vic.

[MRNC309:REN_C3]
Alright? Barry, mate.

[MRNC310:REN_C3]
Now, darling, darling needs a favor.

[MRNC311:REN_C3]
Yeah, I need you to drive me and one of me clients around. Major player.

[MRNC312:REN_C3]
Could sing the birds down from the trees. You'll love him.

[MRNC313:REN_C3]
I'm kind of expensive for a limo service.

[MRNC314:REN_C3]
Yeah, well, rock and roll is a dirty business, cock.

[MRNC315:REN_C3]
Excuse me?

[MRNC316:REN_C3]
Well, this one bloke gave me three million quid, but now he wants it back... cheeky twat.

[MRNC317:REN_C3]
He's threatening to kill my bloke if I don't pay up.

[MRNC318:REN_C3]
Okay... I'll help you, but it's gonna cost.

[MRNC319:REN_C3]
Christ on a bike is that the time? We better go and meet me boy. You are gonna love him.

No. And I'll be honest with you - you're not really my type. Barry, is everything sorted for tonight?

The army just took delivery of some new attack helicopters.

[MDAC409:DIA_C4]
Meanwhile, Diego Mendez thinks he's untouchable, just because no one could get him from the ground.

[MDAC410:DIA_C4]
So...

[MDAC411:DIA_C4]
So how about I sneak into the army base, steal a chopper and use that to attack him?

[MDAC412:DIA_C4]
Heh heh heh! Si, senor!

[MDAC413:DIA_C4]
Si, senor? Are you kidding me? That coke is doing something to your brain, buddy.

No, it just helps me think... and get it on. It'll be easy, but you'll need help.
